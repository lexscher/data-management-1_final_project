Assignment Instructions:

Lab Final Project
Mash-up two open data sources and demonstrate four (4) concepts learned in class.

A report should be produced which uses the mash-up based on an objective or a question it answers. Assume that your project data wrangling and analysis will be built in your choice of Google Colab or IDLE Python. Your report should be in PowerPoint.

Some Ideas (but be creative!)

Access NYC open data and mash it up with CUNY campuses
Access US BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) open data and another source
Access SEC Edgar (XBRL/XML) data and another source
Access United Nations data and another source
Access Covid-19 pandemic data and another source
Here is a list of the valid concepts which count toward the requirement to utilize at least four (4) concepts in the Lab Project for CST2312-HD32, Spring 2023:

concepts = ["functions", "conditionals","iteration", "strings","lists", "dictionaries", "files", "tuples",  "sets", "regex", "api", "json", "xml", "html scraping", “pandas dataframes”, "beautiful soup", "oop", "databases", "data visualization"]    

Lab Final Project Due Date
Completed projects are due to be submitted by the end of the day on Tuesday, 09 May 2023.  Project presentations will be conducted during regularly scheduled class times in the week of 08 May 2023.
